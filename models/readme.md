In this folder all the trained model weights are stored. Specifically, it must contain two folders: `10kws+U+S` and `35kws`. Those contain the weights for every model, for the respective task.

The weights are obtained by training all the models: to do this, run `train_models.py`. Alternatively, they can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c74-zhuSnt1hY_qqpew3TAvMFKTK3VdD/view?usp=sharing).
